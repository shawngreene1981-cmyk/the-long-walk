# The Long Walk

An interactive map of human migration and knowledge loss across 1.8 million years.

**Live map: https://shawngreene1981-cmyk.github.io/the-long-walk/**

A timeline scrubber drives everything. Nothing on the map exists until the
scrubber reaches its date, so the map is watched as much as read.

## What is on it

| | |
|---|---|
| Anchors | 426 (33 flagged leaders) |
| Migration routes | 106 |
| Leader walk-backs | 15 |
| African corridor connectors | 6 |
| Era checkpoints | 60, across 10 ages |
| Sea-level curve | 18 points |

Plus territories, capabilities, diffusions, pauses, continental shelves, ice
sheets, ghost branches, origin nodes and trade routes.

## Every anchor carries an evidence tier

| Tier | Count | |
|---|---|---|
| Well-supported | 317 | |
| Contested / disputed | 81 | |
| Pre-*sapiens* hominin | 26 | a separate category, not a weaker one |
| No verified evidence | 2 | |

Roughly 19% of this map is flagged contested — and that is the point, not a
defect. The aim is to show *how well each claim is supported*, not to assert
what happened. A contested anchor is drawn as prominently as a solid one, in a
different colour, so you can see the shape of the disagreement instead of
having it quietly resolved for you.

## Citing a single anchor

Every anchor has its own address, so a specific claim can be linked directly
rather than asking someone to go and find it. Add `?a=<id>` to the URL:

```
https://shawngreene1981-cmyk.github.io/the-long-walk/?a=cn10
```

That opens the map focused on **Yinxu (Yin Ruins) — the oracle bones**, with
the timeline already set to its earliest dated evidence (~3,276 years ago) and
its popup open.

**You do not need to know the id.** Open any anchor on the map and click
*"Copy link to this anchor"* inside its popup — that gives you the full URL,
ready to paste into a video description, a reply, or a footnote.

A moment in time can be cited the same way with `?t=`, in years before present:

```
https://shawngreene1981-cmyk.github.io/the-long-walk/?t=64400
```

Both forms also work as a hash (`#a=cn10`) for tools that strip query strings.
An unrecognised id is ignored rather than treated as an error, so a truncated
link still opens the map.

## Running it locally

One self-contained HTML file. No build step, no framework, no bundler — clone
the repo and open `index.html` directly in a browser.

Leaflet 1.9.4 and the basemap tiles load from a CDN, so the map itself needs a
network connection. If Leaflet cannot load, the page says so explicitly rather
than showing an empty box.

`clipboard.writeText` requires a secure context, so on `file://` the copy
button falls back to a legacy copy; if that is refused too, it prints the URL
in the button itself rather than losing it. Over the live HTTPS URL it copies
directly.
